        "Just like everyone else, once I had completed my *Introduction to Python* on an MOOC, I was eager to apply what I had learned on a real-world machine learning problem. However, when it actually came time to build something useful, I realized that the toy projects and purely conceptual lessons that I had learned in the Python course did not help much. I have come to realize that this is because, while most of the tutorials for Python and its application on YouTube and other sources are great for learning stand-alone aspects of a project, they seldom give a complete picture of how all the pieces fit together. Since then, through reading, trial and experimentation, and a lot of sleepless nights of debugging, I started to learn how different blocks can be put together to form a coherent project and began realizing that with a little foresight, programming can be used to perfrom anything that you need. These series of tutorials are meant as a way for me to document my approach to a problem and also serve as a guide for you to learn new skills and apply them in a truly end-to-end ML project\n"

In the case of libraries, I will refer to their documentation, GitHub posts on any specific issues that I faced while using them and also any tutorials which I found helpful to gain a good understanding of what I needed to get this project going. Please refer to them if you need help understanding the methods and attributes in a library.\n",
        "3. Although I encourage you to follow along with this tutorial, my suggestion is that you read through it first to understand how to think through the problem, and then use the skills that you learn here to solve a problem that **you find interesting**.\n",
        "4. I will refer to other channels, pages, blogs, etc whenever possible. To learn the skills you need to solve a large problem, there will be a lot of Googling and downtime involved to learn the necessary concepts and tools.\n",
        "5. Everything that I have written here is only meant as a template on how this particular problem can be approached. There are numerous thing which could be done to my code to improve its speed and readability. Since I want to put up tutorials on a weekly basis, I will not be refactoring my code here, but you can always find the latest version of this crawler on my [GitHub](https://github.com/vigvisw) page.\n",

        "Before you start using Colab, I **highly suggest** that you go under *Tools*, click on *Preferences* and check **'Show line numbers'**. This makes it much easier to debug your code when (**not if**) it throws an exception. You might also want to use the **dark mode** to ease the strain on your eyes for a long coding session and change any other settings as you see fit.

With over 9000+ links to crawl across, we are looking at a crawl time in excess of three hours. I ended up having to connect to a local Jupyter Notebook runtime to get it to run for the full length of time needed. The code can be definitely be refactored to get over this issue and if you know of any method to keep Colabs hosted runtime for longer, please let me know."

This version of the pipeline works great when presented with well-structured SQL databases, CSV files or JSON data. However, in the real world, data is hard to collect, messy and presents a number of challenges. Your problem statement might be to build a model that takes in information collected using sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes, and thermometers for example) and make predictions about a dependent variable. If data does not already exist for your project, it can be a challenge to devise your own methods to collect such data. \n",

Many a time, you can find the data that you need through a simple search and save a lot of effort. Failing that try checking if the data that you need can be accessed using an API. May interesting APIs exist, which can make your job a lot simpler. I would like to point out a few interesting ones for those who want to build a dataset using an existing API.\n",

In other cases, you may have to crawl through a website and extract the data that you need. This leads to the infamous [80/20 split](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3228245/the-80-20-data-science-dilemma.html) where up to 80% of your time in an ML project can be sunk into finding, cleaning and restructuring data.\n",

Even this incredibly detailed tutorial starts with a pre-assembled dataset which is often **not indicative** of the real world. The point I am trying to get across is that the most mission critical aspect of an ML project, which more often than not, is the data itself can be hard to find and it is always a good idea to set aside the time to learn the skills require to collect it.

They explain everything in noob friendly language and I suggest that **at the very least** you refer to pages on [HTML Introduction](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp), [HTML Basic Examples](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp), [HTML Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp) and [HTML Attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp). If time permits take a look at [HTML Links](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_links.asp), [HTML Tables](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp) and [HTML Lists](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_lists.asp), since we will be using these tags A LOT to find the information we want from webpages. This was enough to get me started but we will be revisiting this topic in future modules.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **USE** the *Inspect Element* tool. When this toggle is turned on, and you hover the mouse over an element that you want to inspect on Screen 1, the parent tag corresponding to that element will be automatically opened on the HTML tree displayed on Screen 2. This mode can be toggled by clicking the first icon (the one which looks like an arrow in front of a screen) on the top right of Screen 2. You can also toggle it using the keyboard shortcut **Crtl + Shift  + C**. I cannot emphasize how much I wish I had learned to use this tool sooner for finding the HTML structure of the element that I want from Screen 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Using the *toggle device toolbar*, if needed. The toggle device toolbar allows us to change the view between desktop mode and mobile device. Throughout this tutorial, I will be using the desktop view, but your needs may change if the webpage that you are looking to crawl for information supports certain mobile only functions. This mode can be toggled by clicking the second icon (the one which looks like a mobile phone and tablet) on the top right of Screen 2. You can also toggle it using the keyboard shortcut **Crtl + Shift  + M**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE:** From this point forward, I will assume that you are referring back to the Webpage HTML using *Inspect Elements* as and when needed to understand the structure of the elements."

        "When it comes to a large project like this and what will follow, there will be a lot of lines of code involved. In the beginning, it was really difficult for me to wrap my head around all the functions that the program would have to perform. This is an area where Jupyter Notebooks became very useful. You can build up your program function by function and line by line without having to execute everything from scratch. Especially in the case of a web crawler, sending out HTTP requests and getting back responses can be the most time-consuming block of the code. In such cases, using the *cells* of a Jupyter Notebook becomes very handy. \n",

        "We want to build up our program in pieces. If we put everything inside a **for** loop, we will eventually find it very difficult to understand what is going on and debugging the code becomes a nightmare. The strategy I use is to split up the problem into sensible blocks (1. get a list of all makers, 2. get a list of all nav pages for a maker, etc..) and then define functions which perform the vebose tasks that needs to be performed on the blocks. This makes the process of debugging, refactoring and repurposing your code much easier. The next step would be to create a Python **class** that incorporates all these functions. To keep the length and scope of this tutorial manageable, we will not be defining a class for the crawler. I leave it up to the motivated reader to do so. Note that I will, however, be following up on this over at my [GitHub](https://github.com/vigvisw) page in the near future. \n",

        "1. **Crawl Strategy**: This is how we actually want to proceed with the crawl. We do not want to go full Inception on the crawler and go a link within a link within a link. This will eventually lead to us getting lost in nested loops with no way to debug our code. My preferred crawl strategy for this particular crawler is as follows.\n",

Being knowledgeable about multiple fields helps you to come up with novel, never before seen, solutions to hard problems."
